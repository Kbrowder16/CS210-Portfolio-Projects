CS-210 Module Eight Journal Reflection
Project: ChadaTechClocks2 – Dual Clock Display
Purpose of the Project:
This project was designed to simulate two clocks (12-hour and 24-hour formats) and allow users to update the time through a menu. It helped strengthen my understanding of modular programming, formatting output, and user-driven interaction in C++.

What I Did Well:
I kept the code organized by creating separate functions for each task, which made the program easier to manage and understand. I followed the flowchart exactly as instructed and kept main() clean and simple. I'm proud of how I used formatting tools like setw() and setfill() to display both clocks neatly side by side.

Where I Could Improve:
I could have added more validation for user input and added a few more comments throughout the code. Improving those areas would make the code more user-friendly and easier for someone else to follow later on.

What Challenged Me the Most:
Lining up the clocks exactly how I wanted was harder than expected. It took a lot of trial and error to get the formatting right. I looked up examples and read through C++ documentation to figure it out, and that extra effort really helped.

What I’m Taking With Me:
This project helped me get more comfortable with writing modular code and thinking through user experience. I also practiced applying consistent naming conventions and learned how important it is to make code readable — not just functional.

How I Made the Code Maintainable and Readable:
I focused on clean formatting, broke the logic down into reusable functions, and used naming that made sense. I also kept things well-organized so I (or anyone else) could come back later and still understand what’s going on.
